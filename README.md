# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

This is a sample app as found in the https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app site. Just being used as a little fun test area for Rails stuff.
